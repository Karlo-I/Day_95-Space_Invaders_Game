Below is a self-reflection I have submitted to the course provider after completing the project, which I believe will help provide background for this repository.

Reflection:

For this project, the best approach I took was to follow one of the video tutorials online (see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM). Although it wasn't the best approach in terms of utilizing documentation from any particular module (e.g., Pygame), I felt that I learned more than I would have otherwise by simply following the video tutorial and making a few small changes.
